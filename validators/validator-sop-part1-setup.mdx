### Step 0 Purchase Equipment and Assemble NUC

First, you'll need hardware to run the validator software on. [Requirements can be found here](https://hackmd.io/G3MvgV2_RpKxbufsZO8VVg?view) as of 1/27/25, suggested hardware are as follows:

* Asus NUC 14+ Pro

* 32GB RAM (**64GB** preferred)

* NVMe M.2 4TB

* Ethernet connection with 100 Mbps symmetrical (**300 Mbps** preferred)

* USB drive (used to install Linux) 4GB+

* HDMI (or USB) cord and connectable monitor for initial set up

* USB keyboard and mouse (mouse is only required if using Ubuntu desktop to generate new validator keys)

While not a hard requirement, it's also recommended to purchase a 1000+VA sine wave UPS to act as a battery backup in the case of a power failure. Note that in order for this to be effective, you should plug the validator **and** internet infrastructure into the UPS. The goal is to guard against both unclean shutdowns as well as downtime.

Once equipment has been obtained, simply install the RAM and SSD in the NUC. Because some of the below processes require using an air-gapped machine, **do not connect the device to the internet**.

Note: You will also need a small screwdriver to handle installation if assembling yourself.

### Step 1 Generate Staking Data

**Only if setting up a new validator:**

If setting up a new validator (and haven't already generated deposit data and validator key(s)), you'll need to run the deposit tool CLI, and should do so from an **air-gapped machine**.

**If you are not generating new keys, skip to step 2.**

**If you are adding new validators to an existing config, please see the [Addendum](/validators/validator-sop-part1-setup#addendum-adding-validators-to-existing-config) at the bottom of this document**

In order to have a machine ready to go, we will need to install an OS on your new validator hardware built in step 0\. We'll be using Ubuntu Desktop. On your laptop, navigate to [ubuntu.com](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop), download the latest LTS copy of Ubuntu Desktop (as of 2025, _24.04.1 LTS_). In addition, download and install the [Etcher tool](https://www.balena.io/etcher) which will allow you to flash the operating system onto the USB drive. Lastly, download the latest version of the [deposit CLI tool](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/releases) \- you want the **AMD64** version - unzip the executable file.

With all the software and data assembled, run the Etcher tool to flash the USB drive with Ubuntu Desktop using your laptop. Insert the USB into your air gapped machine (built in step 0), connect the machine to a monitor via HDMI (or USB), keyboard, and mouse, and go through the installation process (which should occur automatically). Make sure to choose the minimum settings allowed so things go quickly.

Once the installation is complete, remove the USB drive, and reformat the disk to exFAT so you can move the deposit CLI tool onto the USB drive. You may also want to drop a text file into the USB drive with your withdrawal address to make the next step easier.

Finally, re-insert the USB drive into the NUC and move the deposit CLI tool to your desktop.

Now, run the binary file in a terminal window on your Linux desktop by using the below command (easier if you have your withdrawal address handy for a copy/paste!)

```
sudo ./deposit new-mnemonic --num_validators {#_Validators} --chain mainnet --eth1_withdrawal_address {YourWithdrawalAddress}
```

Replace `{#_Validators}` with the number of validators you want to run (32ETH per), and `{YourWithdrawalAddress}` with an Ethereum address you control.

_NOTE: Once set, the withdrawal address_ _**CANNOT**_ _be changed, so be ABSOLUTELY SURE that it is an address you control the private keys for (or it's a multisig and you control the private keys to the underlying wallets) and correctly specified. For example: --eth1\_withdrawal\_address 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045_

**DO NOT** set the withdrawal address to a central exchange wallet or account. This MUST be an EOA or smart contract wallet, as ETH is not "transferred" but rather "generated" in the wallet via a state change, and that doesn't play nicely with Coinbase/Kraken/etc.

Once you execute the above steps, confirm your withdrawal address within the generated files, and provide your language preferences. You will then be asked to create the validator keystore password. Note this password on the [variables document](../images/variables.xlsx). You will need this later to import the validator(s) into the Consensus Client. Please note that this document will be referenced a number of times below, and is meant to serve as an example for a way to keep a secure paper record of your passwords, file locations, etc.

Next, a seed phrase (mnemonic) will be generated. Back it up somewhere safe. This is **CRITICAL**. You will need this to add additional validators or to regenerate keys if lost. IF YOU LOSE THIS MNEMONIC, YOU MAY LOSE ACCESS TO THE VALIDATOR! _Not your keys, not your coins._

Once you have confirmed your mnemonic your validator(s) will be created. The following files will be generated and placed on your desktop.

* The deposit\_data-\[timestamp\].json file contains the public key(s) for the validator(s) and information about the staking deposit. This file will be used to complete the ETH staking deposit process later in this guide. **This is where you can triple check the withdrawal address**

* The keystore-\[..\].json files contain the encrypted validator signing key. There is one keystore file per validator that you are funding. These will be imported into the Consensus Client for use during validation operations.

* If you lose or accidentally delete the files it is possible to regenerate them using the Staking Deposit CLI tool and your mnemonic via the existing-mnemonic command (see [here](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli#commands)).

Now that you have generated the deposit data, keystore file(s), validator password, and the mnemonic, we can begin setting up the node. You should now copy the generated deposit and keystore files back onto your USB drive. We'll need them later on.

Note: there are no other steps in this process that require you to enter or view your mnemonic phrase, so the air-gapped portion of this process is completed. You can now plug in the Ethernet cord.

### Step 2 Install Linux Server

Navigate to [ubuntu.com](https://ubuntu.com/download/server), download the latest LTS copy of Ubuntu Server (as of 2025, _24.04.1 LTS_). In addition, download and install the [Etcher tool](https://www.balena.io/etcher) which will allow you to flash the operating system onto the USB drive. Then, run the Etcher tool to flash the USB drive with Ubuntu Server.

Once that's complete, pop the USB drive into your NUC, and restart it - also connect it to Ethernet if you haven't already. Upon restart, hold fn+F10 in order to boot from USB. Follow the installation instructions, making sure to select the following settings:

* When setting up hard drive settings, uncheck the LVM box else the full HD cannot be used

* You should make sure no software is downloaded or installed aside from OpenSSH

* **Do not** select "minimum" when installing the software, you will need the items downloaded and installed in the normal process

* Name your device whatever you like - and note this on your variable document

* Create a user when prompted to do so, and set a password for that user that's sufficiently complex - note this on your variable document

Once this process is complete, you should be presented with a terminal window on screen. Likely, you will need to enter your password to gain access to the server.

Next, update the server and install useful utilities by running the following commands:

```
sudo apt -y update && sudo apt -y upgrade && sudo apt dist-upgrade && sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt install -y ccze jq
sudo reboot
```

**Note:** `ccze` provides colorized log output, and `jq` is a JSON parser useful for formatting RPC responses.

After rebooting:

```
df -h
```

That last command is used to ensure that the expected amount of free space on your SSD is available. If this value is less than 75% of the full size of the drive, something went wrong (likely the LVM checkbox during Linux installation), and you'll need to start this step over.

### Step 3 Secure the Server

After the updates and restart complete, it's time to change some security settings.

#### Modify the Default SSH Port

Port 22 is the default SSH port and a common attack vector. Change the SSH port to avoid this.

Choose a port number between 1024–49151 and run the following command to check is not already in use:

```
sudo ss -tulpn | grep ':{YourSSHPortNumber}'
```

A blank response indicates not in use, a red text response indicates it is in use: try a different port.

If confirmed available, modify the default SSH port number by updating your server’s SSH config. Open the config file with the following command:

```
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Find the line Port 22 in the file. Remove the # and change the value to your chosen port. Note this port number on the variables document as you'll need it for LAN access (we're almost ready to do the rest from your laptop!)

Press CTRL + X then Y then ENTER to save and exit.

Restart the SSH service to reflect the changes.

```
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

#### Configure the Firewall

Install UFW:

```
sudo apt install ufw
```

Next, apply UFW defaults:

```
sudo ufw default deny incoming && sudo ufw default allow outgoing
```

Next, we'll need to create some custom rules to allow the requisite network activity/connections

Allow Custom SSH Port:

```
sudo ufw allow {YourSSHPortNumber}/tcp
```

Deny Default SSH Port:

```
sudo ufw deny 22/tcp
```

Allow Execution Client Ports:

```
sudo ufw allow 30303
sudo ufw allow 30305/udp
```

_Note: Port 30303 is used for P2P networking and Discovery v4. Port 30305 is used for Discovery v5 (improved peer discovery protocol). If you need to customize the networking ports, consult the [Reth documentation](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth) for the appropriate flags and ensure those ports are allowed in your firewall._

Allow Prysm:

```
sudo ufw allow 13000/tcp && sudo ufw allow 12000/udp
```

With settings imported, enable the firewall by running:

```
sudo ufw enable
```

Then run the following command to see a list of ports enabled/disabled:

```
sudo ufw status numbered
```

Finally, run the following command to get your local IP:

```
hostname -I
```

Note this on your variables document.

**WITHOUT** disconnecting from the Node, head over to your laptop (or whichever LAN device you plan on accessing the Node from), and attempt to connect. Open a terminal window and input the following command to edit your hosts file so you can refer to the Node by the name you set it as in addition to its IP:

```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

When prompted, enter your password. Now, above the final `::1 localhost line`, create a new line, and add the local IP of your node _(see: variables)_, then a few spaces so you're aligned with the localhost text, and then enter the name of the Node you used above _(see: variables)_.

Now, lets test to see if you can SSH into your Node. Simply open a new terminal window, and enter the following command, subbing in the name of the Node, user, and the SSH port _(see: variables)_.

```
ssh {yourusername}@{node_name OR node_IP} -p {YourSSHPortNumber}
```

Enter your password when prompted. If you are able to log in and see `{user}@{node_name}`, you're set! Once you see this, you can disconnect the Node from the monitor and keyboard, and can preform the remainder of tasks from any laptop or computer on the same LAN using the command above to SSH in. The Node **only** needs to remain connected to power and ethernet (powered via UPS if possible).

#### Configure Fail2Ban

Fail2Ban is an intrusion-prevention program that scans log files and and bans IPs that show malicious activity. If a certain number of failed logins are detected from a specific IP address (within a specified amount of time), that IP address is blocked. This service provides basic protection against brute-force attacks, and can be configured to ignore local IPs.

Install fail2ban, and enable and start the service:

```
sudo apt install -y fail2ban && sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
```

Create the configuration file for the service:

```
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

Then, paste the following configuration into the file:

```
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = {your SSH port}
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 4
# whitelisted IP addresses
ignoreip = 192.168.1.0/24 127.0.0.1/8
```

NOTE: The inclusion of ignoreip = 192.168.1.0/24 127.0.0.1/8 is to allow local IPs to connect (and potentially get passwords wrong) without being blocked.

Press CTRL + X then Y then ENTER to save and exit.

Reload systemd to reflect the changes and start the service. Check the status to make sure it’s running correctly:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
sudo systemctl status fail2ban
```

If it says "active (running)" in green text, you've done it! Press Q to quit (this will not effect the fail2ban service)

#### Disable Root Access

It is best practice to not log in as root in order to maintain security and follow the principle of least-privilege.

First, check to ensure another user besides root can run the sudo command (if you've gotten this far, this is just a double check step). Let's first check sudo access:

```
sudo -l
```

If you see the text "User `{your-username}` may run the following commands on `{device-name}`: (ALL:ALL) ALL" you have sudo privileges with your current user.

Now, lock the root account:

```
sudo passwd -l root
```

You should see the text "passwd: password expiry information changed."

If for any reason you need to unlock the root account:

```
sudo passwd -u root
```

### Step 4 Configure Port Forwarding

From your laptop (or whichever device on the local network you plan on accessing the Node from), log into your router to edit the port forwarding settings. While access is different for each network set up and router, usually you can access your router at 192.168.1.1 or a similar local IP address. Occasionally, instructions can be found on the router itself.

Once you've logged in to your router, edit the port forwarding settings for your Node to forward the following ports:

* **Port 30303** - TCP and UDP - P2P networking and Discovery v4
* **Port 30305** - UDP only - Discovery v5 (improved peer discovery)

These are the same ports we allowed above in the _Secure the Server_ step. Port forwarding these will make it easier for the execution client (Reth) to find suitable peers and accept inbound connections. Failure to do so may result in sub optimal syncing and reduced peer discovery.

### Step 5 Configure Timekeeping

Running validators against a blockchain requires accurate timekeeping in order to ensure proper synchronization with the network. Validators need time accuracy within **0.5 seconds** for proper attestations.

While Ubuntu has time synchronization built in using `systemd-timesyncd`, we'll use **`chrony`** instead, which provides more accurate time synchronization - critical for validators.

Install chrony (this will replace systemd-timesyncd):

```
sudo apt-get install chrony -y
```

Verify chrony is running and check synchronization sources:

```
sudo systemctl status chrony
```

Check the time servers chrony is using:

```
chronyc sources
```

You should see multiple time servers with various symbols (^*, ^+, ^-, ^?) indicating their status.

Check synchronization accuracy:

```
chronyc tracking
```

**Important values to check:**
* **Leap status**: Should say "Normal" (after a few minutes)
* **System time**: Should show offset in milliseconds (< 100ms is good, < 10ms is excellent)
* **Stratum**: Should be 2-4 (lower is better)

**Note:** Right after installation, chrony needs 5-10 minutes to synchronize with time servers. The "Leap status" will show "Not synchronised" initially - this is normal.

Optionally, set your timezone (affects log timestamps only, doesn't impact validation):

```
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```

Select your geographic region and city from the menu.

### Step 6 Generate Client Auth Secret

On the server, communication between the Execution and Consensus clients is secured using a JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication scheme. The JWT is represented by a file that contains a randomly generated 32-byte hex string. The Execution and Consensus clients each make use of the file for message authentication.

First, create a directory to store this file:

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/jwtsecret
```

Then, generate the JWT file using openssl:

```
openssl rand -hex 32 | sudo tee /var/lib/jwtsecret/jwt.hex > /dev/null
```

Finally, check that the file was created as expected:

```
sudo nano /var/lib/jwtsecret/jwt.hex
```

Press CTRL+X to exit

### Step 7 Install Reth

Time to install Reth! All commands provided below are based on the v1.8.2 version of Reth (current as of Oct 2025), but should be adjusted based on whatever the latest version of Reth is [here](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases) - simply expand the Assets section and copy the URL for the 'reth-v...-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz' file. Note that MANY commands below will need to update if this version is updated.

**Full Node vs Archive Node:**

This guide configures Reth as a **full node** (using the `--full` flag), which is the optimal configuration for validators:

* **Full Node**: Stores recent state and enough history to validate the chain. Syncs in hours (especially with snapshots), requires ~1-2TB storage, and is sufficient for all validation operations.
* **Archive Node**: Stores complete historical state since genesis. Takes weeks to sync, requires 3-4TB+ storage, and is only needed for specialized applications like block explorers or historical data analysis.

**For validators, always use a full node.** Archive nodes provide no benefit for validation and waste time and resources.

Curl the Reth build from the above link:

```
cd ~
curl -LO https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/download/v1.8.2/reth-v1.8.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

Extract the files from the archive and copy to the /usr/local/bin directory. The Reth service will run it from there. Modify the file name to match the downloaded version:

```
tar xvf reth-v1.8.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
sudo cp reth /usr/local/bin
```

Clean up the files. Modify the file name to match the downloaded version:

```
cd ~
rm reth-v1.8.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

Reth will be configured to run as a background service. Create an account for the service to run under. This type of account can't log into the server:

```
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false reth
```

Create the data directory. This is required for storing the Ethereum blockchain data:

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/reth
```

Set directory permissions. The Reth user account needs permission to modify the data directory:

```
sudo chown -R reth:reth /var/lib/reth
```

Create a home directory for the Reth user. This is required for Reth's logging functionality:

```
sudo mkdir -p /home/reth
sudo chown reth:reth /home/reth
```

Create a systemd service config file to configure the service:

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/reth.service
```

Then, paste the following configuration into the file:

```
[Unit]
Description=Reth Execution Client (Mainnet)
After=network.target
Wants=network.target

[Service]
User=reth
Group=reth
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
TimeoutStopSec=900
KillSignal=SIGINT

ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/reth node \
  --chain mainnet \
  --full \
  --datadir /var/lib/reth \
  --authrpc.jwtsecret /var/lib/jwtsecret/jwt.hex \
  --authrpc.addr 127.0.0.1 \
  --authrpc.port 8551 \
  --port 30303 \
  --discovery.port 30303 \
  --enable-discv5-discovery \
  --discovery.v5.port 30305 \
  --max-outbound-peers 35 \
  --max-inbound-peers 35 \
  --http \
  --http.addr 127.0.0.1 \
  --http.api eth,net,web3

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
* **`--full` flag**: Runs Reth as a **full node** (not archive). For validators, you only need a full node which stores recent state. Archive nodes store all historical state since genesis and are unnecessary for validation, taking significantly longer to sync (weeks vs hours) and requiring much more disk space.
* **`TimeoutStopSec=900`**: Allows the Reth service 15 minutes to write cached data to disk on ***clean*** shutdown (important for large databases).
* **`KillSignal=SIGINT`**: Explicitly tells systemd to use SIGINT for graceful shutdown (same as Ctrl+C).
* **Port configuration**: Explicitly sets P2P networking ports to 30303 (default) for better peer discovery. This is the default, but better to make explicit.
* **Discovery v5**: Enables the newer, more resilient peer discovery protocol on port 30305 UDP. Improves peer finding and network connectivity.
* **Peer limits**: Limits connections to 35 outbound + 35 inbound (70 total) to reduce bandwidth and resource usage while maintaining excellent connectivity. For gigabit home validators, this balances network contribution with efficiency.

Press CTRL + X then Y then ENTER to save and exit.

#### Optional: Use Merkle Snapshot for Faster Initial Sync

**Why use a snapshot?** Syncing Reth from genesis can take days even with a full node. Using a recent snapshot from Merkle.io can reduce initial sync time to just a few hours.

[Merkle.io](https://www.merkle.io/snapshots) publishes Reth snapshots every Monday and Thursday at `downloads.merkle.io`. Using a snapshot is particularly recommended for new installations or after database corruption.

**To use a Merkle snapshot:**

First, install required dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y lz4 tmux
```

**CRITICAL DISK SPACE WARNING:**
* Compressed snapshot: ~2.1TB
* Uncompressed database: ~3TB
* **With a 4TB SSD, you MUST use streaming method** - downloading tar first requires 5TB+ (2.1TB tar + 3TB extracted)
* Streaming only stores the extracted database (~3TB), leaving adequate free space

**IMPORTANT:** Use `tmux` to run the download to prevent it from being killed if your SSH connection drops. The download takes 18-20 hours.

Start a tmux session:

```
tmux new -s reth-download
```

Then, inside the tmux session, stream download and extract the snapshot:

```
cd /var/lib/reth
sudo -u reth wget -O - https://downloads.merkle.io/reth-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.lz4 | \
  sudo -u reth tar -I lz4 -xvf -
```

**Replace `YYYY-MM-DD`** with the latest snapshot date (most recent Monday or Thursday). Check [Merkle's snapshot page](https://www.merkle.io/snapshots) for the current available dates.

Example for October 16, 2025:
```
cd /var/lib/reth
sudo -u reth wget -O - https://downloads.merkle.io/reth-2025-10-16.tar.lz4 | \
  sudo -u reth tar -I lz4 -xvf -
```

**If download gets interrupted:**

The streaming method is NOT resumable. If interrupted, you must clean up and start over:
```
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/reth/*
# Then rerun the full streaming command from the beginning
```

This is why tmux is critical - it keeps the process running even if SSH disconnects.

**Tmux controls:**
* **Detach from session** (leaves download running): Press `Ctrl+B` then `D`
* **Reattach to session**: `tmux attach -t reth-download`
* **Monitor progress** in another terminal: `watch -n 30 'df -h /var/lib/reth'` or `tail -f /var/lib/reth/wget-log` or `watch -n 60 'du -sh /var/lib/reth'`

This command will:
* Download the Merkle snapshot
* Extract it directly into your data directory (streaming, no temp file)
* Set proper ownership as the reth user

Once the snapshot extraction completes, proceed with starting the service as normal.

**If not using a snapshot:** Reth will sync from genesis with the `--full` flag, which takes 1-3 days. Skip the snapshot download and proceed directly to starting the service.

#### Start Reth Service

Reload systemd to reflect the changes and start the service. Check the status to make sure it's running correctly:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start reth
sudo systemctl status reth
```

If it says "active (running)" in green text, you've done it! Press Q to quit (this will not effect the Reth service)

The sync will begin immediately. Use the journal output to follow the progress or check for errors by running the following command.

```
sudo journalctl -fu reth | ccze
```

Press CTRL+ C to exit (will not affect the Reth service).

Next, enable the Reth service to automatically start on reboot:

```
sudo systemctl enable reth
```

Finally, stop and start reth so it's using all the latest config information:

```
sudo systemctl stop reth
sudo systemctl start reth
```

Now that Reth is all set up, you can check sync status and connected peers using JSON-RPC calls, as Reth doesn't have an interactive console like Geth.

Check the sync status using curl:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}' http://localhost:8545
```

You can also check the count of connected peers by running:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"net_peerCount","params":[],"id":1}' http://localhost:8545
```

After running Reth for a few minutes, check the peer count to ensure it's greater than 0.

### Step 8 Install Prysm

The Prysm Consensus Client is made up of two binaries that provide the functionality of the beacon node and validator, respectively. This step will download and prepare the Prysm binaries.

Time to install Prysm! All commands provided below are based on the 6.1.3 version of Prysm (current as of 10.21.25), but should be adjusted based on whatever the latest version of Prysm is [here](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/releases). Note that many commands below will need to update if this version is updated.

In the Assets section (expand if necessary) copy the download links to the beacon-chain-v…-linux-amd64 file and the validator-v…-linux-amd64 file. Be sure to copy the correct links.
Download the binaries using the commands below. Modify the URL to match the copied download links:

```
cd ~
curl -LO https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/releases/download/v6.1.3/beacon-chain-v6.1.3-linux-amd64
curl -LO https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/releases/download/v6.1.3/validator-v6.1.3-linux-amd64
```

Now, let's rename the files and make them executable and copy them to the /usr/local/bin directory. The Prysm services will run them from there. Modify the file names to match the downloaded version:

```
mv beacon-chain-v6.1.3-linux-amd64 beacon-chain
mv validator-v6.1.3-linux-amd64 validator
```

```
chmod +x beacon-chain
chmod +x validator
```

```
sudo cp beacon-chain /usr/local/bin
sudo cp validator /usr/local/bin
```

Finally, clean up the files

```
rm beacon-chain && rm validator
```

### Step 9 Configure the Beacon Node Service

Set up an account for the services to run under (note: this type of account cannot log into the server):

```
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false prysmbeacon
```

Next, set up the directories and permissions for prysmbeacon:

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/prysm/beacon
sudo chown -R prysmbeacon:prysmbeacon /var/lib/prysm/beacon
```

Next, create and configure the service file:

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/prysmbeacon.service
```

And then paste the following data into the file:

```
[Unit]
Description=Prysm Consensus Client BN (Mainnet)
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target
[Service]
User=prysmbeacon
Group=prysmbeacon
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/beacon-chain \
  --mainnet \
  --datadir=/var/lib/prysm/beacon \
  --execution-endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:8551 \
  --jwt-secret=/var/lib/jwtsecret/jwt.hex \
  --suggested-fee-recipient={FeeRecipientAddress} \
  --checkpoint-sync-url={CheckpointSyncURL} \
  --genesis-beacon-api-url={CheckpointSyncURL} \
  --accept-terms-of-use
Environment=USE_PRYSM_MODERN=true
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Make sure** to replace `{FeeRecipientAddress}` with the address you'd like to receive the validator tip fees.

**Make sure** to replace `{CheckpointSyncURL}` _(x2)_ with a valid checkpoint sync URL [see here for more information](https://eth-clients.github.io/checkpoint-sync-endpoints/) \- be sure to select a Mainnet endpoint.

Press CTRL + X then Y then ENTER to save and exit.

Reload systemd to reflect the changes and start the service. Check the status to make sure it’s running correctly:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start prysmbeacon
sudo systemctl status prysmbeacon
```

If it says "active (running)" in green text, you've done it! Press Q to quit (this will not effect the PrysmBeacon service) - the sync has already begun.

Use the journal output to follow the progress or check for errors by running the following command:

```
sudo journalctl -fu prysmbeacon | ccze
```

Finally, enable the service to automatically start on reboot:

```
sudo systemctl enable prysmbeacon
```

### Step 10 Configure the Validator Service

Set up an account for the services to run under (note: this type of account cannot log into the server):

```
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false prysmvalidator
```

Create a directory to store the validator data:

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/prysm/validator
```

Next, set up the directories and permissions for prysmbeacon:

```
sudo chown -R prysmvalidator:prysmvalidator /var/lib/prysm/validator
```

Next, create and configure the service file by running:

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/prysmvalidator.service
```

And then paste the following data into the file:

```
[Unit]
Description=Prysm Consensus Client VC (Mainnet)
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target
[Service]
User=prysmvalidator
Group=prysmvalidator
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/validator \
  --datadir=/var/lib/prysm/validator \
  --wallet-dir=/var/lib/prysm/validator \
  --wallet-password-file=/var/lib/prysm/validator/password.txt \
  --suggested-fee-recipient={FeeRecipientAddress} \
  --accept-terms-of-use
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Make sure** to replace `{FeeRecipientAddress}` with the address you'd like to receive the validator tip fees.

Press CTRL + X then Y then ENTER to save and exit.

Reload systemd to reflect the changes and start the service. Check the status to make sure it’s running correctly:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start prysmvalidator
sudo systemctl status prysmvalidator
```

If it says "active (running)" in green text, you've done it! Press Q to quit (this will not effect the PrysmValidator service) - the sync has already begun.

Use the journal output to follow the progress or check for errors by running the following command:

```
sudo journalctl -fu prysmvalidator  | ccze
```

Finally, enable the service to automatically start on reboot:

```
sudo systemctl enable prysmvalidator
```

Now that the beacon-chain, validator, and execution client software is all set up, you should run the following commands to check sync status:

Check the sync status using JSON-RPC (it will work now!):

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}' http://localhost:8545
```

You can also check the peer count:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"net_peerCount","params":[],"id":1}' http://localhost:8545
```

### Step 11 Import Validator Keys

To import the keys into Prysm, we'll need to get them onto the same machine.

#### Copy Validator Keystore File(s) to Server

Before we transfer over the Validator Keystore file(s), we'll need to create a place to store them:

```
sudo mkdir -p $HOME/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys
```

Next, ensure your user has control of that folder:

```
sudo chown -R {yourusername}:{yourusername} $HOME/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys
```

Now, plug the USB into your Node from Step 1 (remember Step 1?).

Back in terminal, check to see if the drive is recognized:

```
sudo fdisk -l
```

This will list all available disks and partitions. You should see the USB drive listed as a block device, such as /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc, and specific drives underneath. Look for your USB drive and note its code (e.g. sdb1 or sdc1).

Create a mount point for the USB drive by running the following command:

```
sudo mkdir /mnt/usb
```

Then, mount the USB drive to the mount point, replacing sdb1:

```
sudo mount /dev/{sdb1} /mnt/usb
```

Check that the USB drive is connected by looking at all mounted drives:

```
df -h
```

Now, it's time to copy the files from the USB to the proper folders within the Node. First, let's get a list of all files by running:

```
ls /mnt/usb
```

This should show something like the following

> deposit\_data-1682896118.json keystore-m\_12381\_3600\_0\_0\_0-1682896115.json

Note that while you will only ever have 1 deposit file (regardless of the amount of validators), you will have 1 keystore file for each validator you are setting up on the Node. You only need to move the keystore file(s) to the validator\_keys folder.

Now that we have the file names, we issue a command to copy those files from /mnt/usb to $HOME/staking-deposit-cli/validator\_keys:

```
cp /mnt/usb/{keystore-filename.json} $HOME/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys/
```

If you have more than 1 validator key, you will need to rerun the above command once for each. **BE SURE TO ONLY HAVE 1 COPY OF EACH VALIDATOR KEY**.

Before unmounting the USB, let's verify that the files were placed into the folder correctly by running:

```
ls $HOME/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys/
```

If you see 1 copy of each validator key you intended to move, you're all set!

Now, unmount the USB:

```
sudo umount /mnt/usb
```

#### Import the Validator Keystore Files into Prysm

**REMEMBER: If you import the same keystore twice OR run the same keystore on multiple nodes at the same time YOU WILL GET** [**SLASHED**](https://www.blocknative.com/blog/an-ethereum-stakers-guide-to-slashing-other-penalties)**!**

Now we will run the validator import process. You will need to provide the directory where the generated keystore-\[..\].json files are located. E.g. $HOME/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys (as determined above in this step)

```
sudo systemctl stop prysmvalidator
sudo /usr/local/bin/validator accounts import --keys-dir=$HOME/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys --wallet-dir=/var/lib/prysm/validator --mainnet
sudo systemctl start prysmvalidator
```

You will then be presented with a terms of use which you will need to accept in order to continue.

Following your acceptance, you'll be prompted to create a wallet password. Note that this is a **different** password than the validator password set in step 1 when generating the keystore files. This password will be used by Prysm to decrypt the validator files. Note this password on the variables document.

After setting your wallet password, you'll be asked to enter the validator keystore password, this is the one referenced above and created during step 1\. Once this password is entered, all validator keystore file(s) will be imported.

#### Create a Wallet Password File

Create a file to store the wallet password so the Prysm validator service (set up below) can access the wallet without you having to supply the password:

```
sudo nano /var/lib/prysm/validator/password.txt
```

This will create a new text file and open a nano text editor. Type your password you just created for your validator wallet into the the file.

Press CTRL + X then Y then ENTER to save and exit.

Let's now check that Prysm can see the password:

```
sudo systemctl status prysmvalidator
```

Before continuing to the deposit step, let's do one more permissions check:

```
sudo chown -R prysmvalidator:prysmvalidator /var/lib/prysm/validator && sudo chown -R {yourusername}:{yourusername} /var/lib/prysm/validator
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

### Step 12 Fund the Validators

Now that the Consensus Client is up and running, to actually begin staking on the Ethereum network you will need to deposit ETH to fund your validators.

**Note: DO NOT continue until your execution and consensus clients are fully synced. If they have not and your validator(s) become active on the network, you would be subject to inactivity penalties. You can determine sync status by checking the status of the Beacon Chain or through JSON-RPC calls to Reth, both methods are described above.**

With the deposit file in hand and an EOA with 32ETH per validator + some spare ETH for gas, head to the [Ethereum Launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/)

Click on Become a Validator, click through the warning steps and continue through the screens until you get to the Generate Key Pairs section. Select the number of validators you are going to run. Choose a value that matches the number of validators you created in Step 1.

Scroll down, check the box if you agree, and click Continue.

You will be asked to upload the deposit\_data-\[timestamp\].json file. You generated this file in Step 1\. _(Note: There are no security concerns copying the file or having access to it on a public computer)_. Double check that inside the file the withdrawal address is set correctly. When satisfied, browse or drag the file to upload and click continue.

Connect your wallet. Choose MetaMask (or one of the other supported wallets), log in, select the account where you have your ETH and click Continue.

Your MetaMask balance will be displayed. The site will allow you to continue only if you have selected Mainnet and you have a sufficient ETH balance.

A summary shows the number of validators and total amount of ETH required. Tick the boxes if you agree and click continue.

If you are ready to deposit click on `Initiate All Transactions`.

This will pop open MetaMask (or one of the other supported wallets) where you can confirm and broadcast each transaction.

Once all the transactions have successfully completed you are done! WOOOOOOO! Congratulations you have deposited your stake!

#### Check the Status of Your Validator Deposits

Newly added validators can take a while to activate. You can check the status of your keys with these steps:

1. Copy your wallet address used to make the deposit

2. Go to [Beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in/)

3. Search for your key(s) using your wallet address

Digging into a specific validator we can see a `Status` section that provides an activation estimate time for each validator.

That’s it. You now have a functioning Execution and Consensus client and the staking deposit done. Once your deposit is active you will automatically begin staking and earning rewards.

Probably a good time to _touch grass_.

#### Clean Up `validator_keys`

While not essential as you can always regenerate them using your mnemonic, it's good practice to back up the `validator_keys` directory (typically `$HOME/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys`) on a USB for [emergencies](./validator-sop-part3-emergency.mdx).

After ensuring you have a backup of these files  as described in [Step 1 Generate Staking Data](/validators/validator-sop-part1-setup#step-1-generate-staking-data), you can safely remove the validator_keys directory. Note that this will not impact your existing validators, as in [Step 11 Import Validator Keys](/validators/validator-sop-part1-setup#step-11-import-validator-keys) the validator_keys are imported into the validator instance. The copies referenced above are "extra":

```
sudo rm -r $HOME/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys
```
