This guide is heavily based off of Somer Esat's [guides](https://someresat.medium.com), CoinCashew's [guides](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjxvYzFvZmCAxWhD1kFHcQiAH0QFnoECBQQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coincashew.com%2Fcoins%2Foverview-eth%2Fguide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet&usg=AOvVaw1dMCm5BKdKm5z7JoK1TDtD&opi=89978449), and the Stake Local Dashboard [guide](https://docs.stakelocal.io). We stand on the shoulders of those that came before us - thank you!

Overall flow of the guide is as follows:

* Generate the staking Deposit Data and Validator Keystore(s) **only if setting up a new validator**

* Prepare the Ubuntu Server (updates, firewall, security, etc.)

* Set up the Geth Execution Client node and sync it with the Ethereum mainnet

* Set up the Prysm Consensus Client and sync with other Beacon Nodes

* Deposit 32 ETH to activate the staking Validator(s) **only if setting up a new validator**

* Importing Validator Keystore(s) from depreciated Validator **only if re-creating a defunct or otherwise offline validator**

* Appendices covering updates, pruning, MEV-boost, exiting

* Emergency Action Plans

* Monitoring with use of Grafana locally

In addition to hardware as described in the next step, you should have a printed copy of the [Variables](../images/variables.xlsx) document, which will be used frequently to keep track of information that should **never be stored electronically or otherwise shared**.
