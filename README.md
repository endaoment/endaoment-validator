# Validator Guide: Readme

![Praise Leslie](.imgs/leslie.png)

## Abstract

This series of documents provides guidance on setting up and managing an Ethereum Validator (including updating, pruning, etc.). Additionally, emergency protocols are provided in the case of an unrecoverable error on the node or the manager of a validator disappears (but the validator can be accessed).

This guide assumes use of MacOS on the connected device (LAN). While anyone can learn, this guide is meant for individuals who are tech savvy, and comfortable in command line without a GUI.

Overall flow of the guide is as follows:

- Generate the staking Deposit Data and Validator Keystore(s) **only if setting up a new validator**
- Prepare the Ubuntu Server (updates, firewall, security, etc.)
- Set up the Geth Execution Client node and sync it with the Ethereum mainnet
- Set up the Prysm Consensus Client and sync with other Beacon Nodes
- Deposit 32 ETH to activate the staking Validator(s) **only if setting up a new validator**
- Importing Validator Keystore(s) from depreciated Validator **only if re-creating a defunct or otherwise offline validator**
- Appendices covering updates, pruning, exiting
- Emergency Action Plans that cover the cases described above
- Monitoring instructions for use of Grafana locally

In addition to hardware as described in the next step, you should have a printed copy of the [Variables](.imgs/variables.xlsx) document, which will be used frequently to keep track of information that should **never be stored electronically or otherwise shared**.
